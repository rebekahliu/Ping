# Ping

## Overview

Ping is a privacy-conscious, location-sharing mobile app. When you ping your friends to get their location, the app automatically sends them your location too. By leveraging social relationship and trust, Ping allows users to make their location available 24/7, but ensures that location is only accessed when it matters.

## Functionalities and MVPs

- Facebook auth
- Suggested friends list from FB
